    <p> One of my first loves is crochet! I love to make unique pieces for family
    and friends, especially around the holidays. Although I love the craft, it
    sometimes can be time consuming. Though I must say, as soon as I pick up my hook
    and start a new project, all of my worries go away. </p>

      stores and my own collection)!</h3>

    <h3> Trials and Tribulations</h3>
  <div id="div4">  <p> Something else that should be taken into account when starting your project is how much yarn will
      be used for whatever you desire to make. I cannot, and I mean <em>CANNOT</em> express to someone how
      many times I've gone to work on something, and got super into it, even more than halfway maybe, and then...
      bam. All of a sudden I see that I'm done with this skein and now I've got to stop working. More often than
      not that's what I'll do but on the rare occasion that it's not 2am or I'm feeling social, I'll go out right
      then and there to see if JoAnn's didn't run out of my go-to colors. Definitely not my favorite (or most used)
      option, but sometimes a garment needs to be <em>*~expedited~*.</em></p> </div>
