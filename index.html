<div id="div4">   <p id="para1"> Hello! My name is Kay'ah and I am 19 years old. My end (long term) goal is to be a project manager in
   the technology industry, but as far as short tem goes I'm looking forward to seeing where my Per Scholas journey takes me. Outside of tech, one of my favorite things to do is travel. I also
   love to go hiking, listen to music and hang out with my friends. </p>

  <div id="div2"> <p> As I said before, one of my all time loves is travelling. One of my favorite
     places that I've been to is Cusco, Peru. Not only was I able to sightsee and
     envelop myself in many cultural experiences, but I also was able to give back to
     the community. While there, my group and I had the opportunity to volunteer at a
   K-8 school within a local village. Overall, it's definitely one of my most memorable trips.</p></div>


<p class="para2"> Though travelling overseas is always fun, sometimes it's even better to just relax in a car
    and take in the scenery (especially when you aren't the driver :). I really wanted to add some of
    my all-time favorite states, but I had a iintrusive thought. <em> How can you narrow down your top
    three states of all time???</em> But just as soon as I had that thought,the answer hit me like a
    ton of bricks. The way to capture the devotion and attention of others is through their stomachs of course!
    So here is my all-time favorite places food-wise. Every single type of cuisisne known to man is within these
  states, from big chain dining to small locally owned businesses (my personal fav). I'm getting hungry just at <thead>
    thought of some of those mouth-watering dishes...
